;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a function that automatically creates
;; snippets for PHP standard library functions, for use with the
;; YASnippets package, available at:
;;
;;     https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet
;;
;; This package also requires php-mode, available at:
;;
;;     https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode
;;
;; To use this package you need to bind the utility function
;; `yas/create-php-snippet' to a key of your choice.  Since this
;; package requires php-mode, and since it is most useful when writing
;; PHP code, you may want to use a key-binding that only works when
;; using php-mode.  For example:
;;
;;     (define-key php-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-y") 'yas/create-php-snippet)
;;
;; Now if you type the name of a PHP function and press `C-c C-y' it
;; will expand into a snippet containing all of the parameters, their
;; names, any default values, et cetera.

;;; Code:

(defconst php-auto-yasnippet-version "0.1"
  "The version number for the php-auto-yasnippet package.")

(provide 'php-auto-yasnippets)
