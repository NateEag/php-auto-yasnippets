/* Snippets can have 'directives', documented here:
 *
 *     http://capitaomorte.github.com/yasnippet/snippet-development.html
 *
 * We need to create two directives: '#key' and '#name'.  They tell
 * YASnippet what to look for to trigger the expansion of the snippet
 * (#key) and what to show in the menu of available snippets (#name).
 * The name of the function suffices for both of these.
 *
 * If possible we also add the '#group' directive.  This directive
 * will help Emacs organize the snippets into sub-menus, making it
 * easier for the user to navigate once he starts creating a large
 * number of snippets with this program.  PHP groups many functions
 * into 'extensions', so we use the extension name for the group name.
 * Thus a function like json_encode() will get the directive '#group:
 * json'.  However, not all functions belong to an extension.  If
 * there is no extension we do not add the '#group' directive at all.
 *
 * Finally we put all of the directives together into a single string
 * that we will attach to the rest of the output later.
